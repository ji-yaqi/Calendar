By pressing the drop-down button, you will see the details -> time of the event, edit or delete event.

Our creative portions are:
1, Users can tag an event with a particular category and color those tags in the calendar view (as you can see from the legend at the top).
2, Users can share their calendar with additional users. And the shared events will be colored differently from normal tag.
3, Users can create group events that display on multiple users calendars
Meanwhile, we use a dropdown button to list events.
